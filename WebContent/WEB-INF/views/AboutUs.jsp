				<h4>Vision</h4>

					various services starting from student application, application
					receipt, processing, sanction and disbursal of various scholarships

					directly into beneficiaries account without any leakages.

				<h4>Mission</h4>
				<p>Why we do it? Apprenticeship is a time tested way of learning
					a craft or trade under a Master Craftsman through the ages.
					Apprenticeship Training Scheme is a scheme where young, technically
					qualified people undergo training under a Master Trainer to become
					equipped for jobs in the Modern Scenario. It has the double benefit
					of earning while learning. Apprenticeship is an agreement between a
					person (an apprentice) who wants to learn a skill and an employer
					who needs a skilled worker. The Apprentices are taught the latest
					applications, processes and methodologies in their respective
					fields of work from some of the most renowned organisations in
					India. This also acts as a transition phase for a school / college
					student from classroom to a working background. The apprentice also
					learns soft skills, work culture, ethics and organisational
					behaviour while undergoing training. This goes a long way in
					helping him/ her secure permanent employment in the future. At the
					end of one year training they are issued a Certificate attesting to
					their training and proficiency in a particular field. This serves
					as an experience certificate when they seek employment after their
					training.</p>
